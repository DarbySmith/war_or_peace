## War or Peace

War is a classic card game where two players split a deck of cards evenly and continuously battle each other until one person loses all of their cards. There are three types of battles that can occur in a game of war: Normal, War, and Mutually Assured Destruction. A normal battle is when both players reveal their top card and the player with a higher value card keeps both. A war turn is when both players top card have the same value, so each player must place two more cards face down and one face up. The player with the highest value last card keeps all cards in play. Mutally assured destruction is similar to war, but if the final car is also the same all cards are removed from game play.
